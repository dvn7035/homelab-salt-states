This is my configuration for my raspberry pi. Some of the states 
are meant to be run headless and some with a master. You can use this
as inspiration for projects on your pi, but be aware some of the
configuration only applies to my situation (e.g. the authorized_key
file specifies that my private ssh key can log in as root over ssh;
probably something you don't want me to be able to do to your pi).

Notes for myself on fresh raspbian install on whitebase:

sudo su
cd /root
raspi-config

#Follow instructions here to install salt-minion
#https://repo.saltstack.com/#raspbian

apt install git
git clone https://github.com/dvn7035/raspberry-pi-salt-states.git
cp -f raspberry-pi-salt-states/salt-minion-no-master/minion /etc/salt/minion
# also edit minion_id 
service salt-minion restart
ln -s $(pwd)/raspberry-pi-salt-states/ /srv/salt
salt-call --local state.apply

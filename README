This is my configuration for my raspberry pi. The states are meant
to be run headless without a salt master server. You can use this
as inspiration for projects on your pi, but be aware some of the
configuration only applies to my situation (e.g. the sshd_config
file specifies that my private ssh key can log in as root over ssh;
probably something you don't want me to be able to do to your pi).

To apply this salt state:

curl -o bootstrap-salt.sh -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
sudo sh bootstrap-salt.sh git develop
git clone https://github.com/dvn7035/salt-journey.git
ln -s salt-journey/ /srv/salt
salt-call --local state.apply

This is my configuration for my raspberry pi. The states are meant
to be run headless without a salt master server. You can use this
as inspiration for projects on your pi, but be aware some of the
configuration only applies to my situation (e.g. the authorized_key
file specifies that my private ssh key can log in as root over ssh;
probably something you don't want me to be able to do to your pi).

Follow instructions here to install salt-minion
https://repo.saltstack.com/#debian

Then run:
# apt install git
# git clone https://github.com/dvn7035/raspberry-pi-salt-states.git
# ln -s salt-journey /srv/salt
# salt-call --local state.apply
